## Part 1. Card

### **Analysis** 

Because the head file is given, I just need to complete the function as required. Special cards' effect function should be overwrite to fit the requirements.

### Code

```C++
Card::Card(string name, int attack, int defense){
    this->attack = attack;
    this->defense = defense;
    this->name = name;
}

void Card::effect(Card& oppenentCard, Player& player, Player& opponent){}

double Card::power(Card opponentCard){
    return this->attack - opponentCard.defense / 2;
}

ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Card& card){
    os << card.name << " " << card.attack << " " << card.defense << endl;
    return os;
}
```

```C++
BigBossCard::BigBossCard(string name, int attack, int defense): Card(name, attack, defense) {}

void BigBossCard::effect(Card& oppenentCard, Player& player, Player& opponent) {
    for (Card& c : player.deck) {
        c.attack += oppenentCard.attack;
        c.defense += oppenentCard.defense;
    }
    for (int i = opponent.deck.size() - 1; i >-1; i--) {
        if (opponent.deck[i].attack == oppenentCard.attack || opponent.deck[i].defense == oppenentCard.defense) {
            opponent.deck.erase(opponent.deck.begin() + i);
        }
    }
}
```

```C++
ExchangeCard::ExchangeCard(string name, int attack, int defense): Card(name, attack, defense) {}

void ExchangeCard::effect(Card& oppenentCard, Player& player, Player& opponent){
    int tmp = oppenentCard.attack;
    oppenentCard.attack = oppenentCard.defense;
    oppenentCard.defense = tmp;
}
```

### Result & Verification	

```c++
	card.effect(player.hand[0], player, opponent);
    card3.effect(card4, player, opponent);


    cout << opponent.deck.size() << endl;
    cout << player.deck.size() << endl;
    cout << endl;
    player.displayHand();
    cout << endl;
    player.draw();
    player.play(0);
    player.displayHand();
    cout << endl;
    cout << player.deck.size();
```

## Part 2. Player

### **Analysis** 

I found a serious problem in class Player. **The deck and hand should use pointer **

**instead of vector**. Because using vector will lead to the special cards' effect function

become useless. It will call the effect() in Card.cpp not in it's subclass. But I don't 

change the type of deck and hand, for I don't know how test frame was written.üôÅÔ∏è

### Code

```C++
Player::Player(vector<Card>& deck, string name) {
    this->deck = deck;
    this->name = name;
    hand = {};
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        draw();
    }
}

void Player::draw() {
    this->hand.push_back(*deck.begin());
    this->deck.erase(deck.begin());
}

Card Player::play(int index) {
    Card tmp = this->hand[index];
    this->hand.erase(hand.begin() + index);
    return tmp;
}

void Player::displayHand() {
    for (Card c : hand) {
        cout << c;
    }
}
```

### Result & Verification	

The result mentioned above can be varification by the following code.

```C++
std::vector<Card> deck = {card, card2, card3, card4, card5, card6, card4, card4, card4};

    std::vector<Card> oppenentDeck = {card4, card4, card, card2, card3, card4, card5};
    
    Player player = Player(deck, "John");
    Player opponent = Player(oppenentDeck, "Alice");

    Card c1 = player.play(1);
    Card c2 = opponent.play(0);
    c1.effect(c2, player, opponent);
    cout << c2 << endl;
    card2.effect(c2, player, opponent);
    cout << c2 << endl;
```

### Difficulties & Solutions

None



### Others

I write a cmake file to compile the program. Use it to run the program
