\section{Development Plan}

Among the topics provided, we have chosen the parking lot management system as our project, which requires us to design a rather complex FSM and thus the process of completing this project gave us a lot of improvement in our understanding of digital logic and our ability to code.

\subsection{Task Assignments \& Contribution of Members}

As a whole, in this project, the three group members had a similar workload, and there were sufficient and timely communications and mutual assistance during the implementation process. Due to the heavy functionality of our selection (parking lot management system), for complex modules, the leading member of implementation is listed below, while the rest of the modules were reasonably evenly distributed. After all, we summarize the percentage of group members' contributions as 33 \% - 33 \% - 33 \%.
