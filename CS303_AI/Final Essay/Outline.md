-   Discussion of their limitations and challenges

IV. Deep Learning Era of semantic segmentation

-   Explanation of how deep learning revolutionized semantic segmentation
-   Overview of key architectures, such as FCN, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN
-   Discussion of their performance and evaluation methods

V. Recent Advances in Semantic Segmentation

-   Overview of recent developments in the field, such as attention mechanisms, lightweight architectures, and domain adaptation
-   Discussion of their impact and potential future directions for research

VI. Conclusion

-   Summarize key points discussed in the essay
